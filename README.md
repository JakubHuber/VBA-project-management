# VBA-project-management
Manage VBA project, modules, class, other files.

Trying to create program for managing VBA projects specialy VBA code listed in modules, classes.
Purpose of that is that people keep code for reuse for example in Word files or look up in previous projects bas/class files.
Instead of that they coud use program which lists project treeview and code snipsets.
